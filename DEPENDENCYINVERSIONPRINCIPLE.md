## D - Dependency inversion principle

The dependency inversion principle is a way to decouple software modules.

Depending on which source one refers to, Dependency Inversion Principle, as defined by **Robert C. Martin**, can be defined in any of the following ways

    Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.
                         OR                          
Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
                         OR                          
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
