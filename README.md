# SOLID Principles

SOLID is an acronym for 5 important design principles when doing OOP (Object Oriented Programming).

The intention of these principles is to make software designs more understandable, easier to maintain and easier to extend.
As a software engineer, these 5 principles are essential to know.

In this article, will be explaining these principles, giving examples of how they are violated, and how to correct them so they are compliant with SOLID. Examples will be given in Java, but applies to any OOP language.

* [S — Single responsibility principle](https://github.com/IamPatilDipak/Software-Design/blob/master/SINGLERESPONSIBILITYPRINCIPLE.md)

* [O — Open/closed principle](https://github.com/IamPatilDipak/Software-Design/blob/master/OPENCLOSEDPRINCIPLE.md)

* [L — Liskov substitution principle](https://github.com/IamPatilDipak/Software-Design/blob/master/LISKOVSUBSTITUTIONPRINCIPLE.md)

* [I — Interface segregation principle](https://github.com/IamPatilDipak/Software-Design/blob/master/INTERFACESEGREGATIONPRINCIPLE.md)

* [D - Dependency inversion principle](https://github.com/IamPatilDipak/Software-Design/blob/master/DEPENDENCYINVERSIONPRINCIPLE.md)
