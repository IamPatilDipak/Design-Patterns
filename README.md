# SOLID Principles

SOLID is an acronym for 5 important design principles when doing OOP (Object Oriented Programming).

The SOLID principle helps in reducing tight coupling. Tight coupling means a group of classes are highly dependent on one another which you should avoid in your code. Opposite of tight coupling is loose coupling and your code is considered as a good code when it has loosely-coupled classes. Loosely coupled classes minimize changes in your code, helps in making code more reusable, maintainable, flexible and stable.

As a software engineer, these 5 principles are essential to know.

In this article, will be explaining these principles, giving examples of how they are violated, and how to correct them so they are compliant with SOLID. Examples will be given in Java, but applies to any OOP language.

* [S — Single responsibility principle](https://github.com/IamPatilDipak/Software-Design/blob/master/SINGLERESPONSIBILITYPRINCIPLE.md)

* [O — Open/closed principle](https://github.com/IamPatilDipak/Software-Design/blob/master/OPENCLOSEDPRINCIPLE.md)

* [L — Liskov substitution principle](https://github.com/IamPatilDipak/Software-Design/blob/master/LISKOVSUBSTITUTIONPRINCIPLE.md)

* [I — Interface segregation principle](https://github.com/IamPatilDipak/Software-Design/blob/master/INTERFACESEGREGATIONPRINCIPLE.md)

* [D - Dependency inversion principle](https://github.com/IamPatilDipak/Software-Design/blob/master/DEPENDENCYINVERSIONPRINCIPLE.md)
